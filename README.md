# Plotting-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
## Introduction

This project uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set".


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken
from
the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI
web site</a>:

<ol>
<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_2</b>: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_3</b>: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.</li>
</ol>

## data description

* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. 

*Data from the dates 2007-02-01 to
2007-02-02 is used. 

* The dataset includes missing values that are coded as `?`.


## Purpose

The overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 using the base plotting system.



For each plot you should

* Each plot is constructed and saved as a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Each of the plot files is named as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.)
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. The codes include code for reading
the dataso that the plot can be fully reproduced.
